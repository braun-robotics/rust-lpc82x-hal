//! # LPC82x Hardware Abstraction Layer
//!
//! Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the NXP LPC82x series of ARM Cortex-M0+
//! microcontrollers.
//!
//! ## Using LPC82x HAL in a Library
//!
//! Writing a library on top of LPC82x HAL is pretty simple. All you need to do
//! is include it via Cargo, by adding the following to you `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies.lpc82x-hal]
//! git = "https://github.com/braun-robotics/rust-lpc82x-hal.git"
//! ```
//!
//! With that in place, you can just reference the crate in you Rust code, like
//! this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! // lib.rs
//!
//! extern crate lpc82x_hal;
//! ```
//!
//! That's it! Now you can just start using the APIs from LPC82x HAL. For
//! libraries, it is recommended to just take (mutable) references to anything
//! that's needed, and leave initialization to the user.
//!
//! ## Using LPC82x HAL in an Application
//!
//! To use LPC82x HAL in your application, you need to go through a bit of
//! additional trouble. This section tries to walk you through some of the
//! basics, but it's not a complete tutorial. Please refer to a more complete
//! example, like [cortex-m-quickstart], for additional details.
//!
//! ### Runtime Support
//!
//! Including LPC82x HAL in your application via Cargo is mostly the same as it
//! is for libraries, but with one addition. You need to enable runtime support
//! when including the crate in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies.lpc82x-hal]
//! git      = "https://github.com/braun-robotics/rust-lpc82x-hal.git"
//! features = ["rt"]
//! ```
//!
//! The runtime support will provide you with some basics that are required for
//! your program to run correctly. However, it needs to know how the memory on
//! your microcontroller is set up.
//!
//! You can get that information from the user manual. To provide it to LPC82x
//! HAL, create a file called `memory.x` in your project root (the directory
//! where `Cargo.toml` is located). `memory.x` should look something like this:
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! MEMORY
//! {
//!     FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 32K
//!     RAM   : ORIGIN = 0x10000000, LENGTH = 8K
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Runtime support is provided by the [cortex-m-rt] crate. Please refer to the
//! cortex-m-rt documentation for additional details.
//!
//! ### Build System
//!
//! The build system needs to be set up to compile and link a binary for LPC82x.
//! Cargo alone is not enough for this, as its support for embedded development
//! is currently limited. [Xargo] exists to fill the gap in the meantime. You
//! can install it via `cargo install`:
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! $ cargo install xargo
//! ```
//!
//! Add a new file, `Xargo.toml` right next to your `Cargo.toml`, with the
//! following contents:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [dependencies.core]
//! stage = 0
//!
//! [dependencies.compiler_builtins]
//! stage    = 1
//! features = ["c", "mem"]
//! ```
//!
//! You might not need all those optional features of `compiler_builtin`, so
//! feel free to experiment.
//!
//! Additionally, you need to tell Cargo how to link your project. Create the
//! file `.cargo/config` in your project directory, and add the following
//! contents:
//!
//! ``` toml
//! [target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
//! rustflags = [
//!     "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
//!     "-C", "linker=arm-none-eabi-ld",
//!     "-Z", "linker-flavor=ld"
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! This tells Cargo to use the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain for linking. You
//! need to install this separately. How to do so is dependent on your platform
//! and left as an exercise to the reader.
//!
//! If everything is set up correctly, you can build your project with the
//! following command:
//!
//! ``` ignore
//! $ xargo build --release --target=thumbv6m-none-eabi
//! ```
//!
//! ### Uploading the Binary
//!
//! There are many ways to upload the binary to the microcontroller. How to do
//! this is currently beyond the scope of this documentation, but
//! [this fork of lpc21isp] is known to work.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The following is an example of a simple application that blinks an LED.
//!
//! ``` no_run
//! extern crate lpc82x;
//! extern crate lpc82x_hal;
//!
//! use lpc82x_hal::Peripherals;
//! use lpc82x_hal::clock::Ticks;
//! use lpc82x_hal::gpio::PIO0_3;
//! use lpc82x_hal::sleep::{
//!     self,
//!     Sleep,
//! };
//!
//! // Initialize the peripherals. This is unsafe, because we're only allowed to
//! // create one instance on `Peripherals`.
//! let mut peripherals = unsafe {
//!     Peripherals::new(
//!         lpc82x::CorePeripherals.take().unwrap(),
//!         lpc82x::Peripherals.take().unwrap(),
//!     )
//! };
//!
//! // Let's save some peripherals in local variables for convenience. This one
//! // here doesn't require initialization.
//! let mut syscon = peripherals.syscon.api;
//!
//! // Other peripherals need to be initialized. Trying to use the API before
//! // initializing it will actually lead to compile-time errors.
//! let mut gpio = peripherals.gpio.handle.init(&mut syscon);
//! let mut swm  = peripherals.swm.api.init(&mut syscon);
//! let mut wkt  = peripherals.wkt.init(&mut syscon);
//!
//! // We're going to need a clock for sleeping. Let's use the IRC-derived clock
//! // that runs at 750 kHz.
//! let clock = peripherals.syscon.irc_derived_clock.enable(
//!     &mut syscon,
//!     peripherals.syscon.irc,
//!     peripherals.syscon.ircout,
//! );
//!
//! // Configure PIO0_3 as GPIO output, so we can use it to blink an LED.
//! let mut pio0_3 = peripherals.gpio.pins.pio0_3;
//! pio0_3.disable_function(
//!     &mut peripherals.swm.fixed_functions.swclk,
//!     &mut swm,
//! );
//! let mut pio0_3 = pio0_3
//!     .as_gpio_pin(&gpio)
//!     .as_output();
//!
//! // Let's already initialize the durations that we're going to sleep for
//! // between changing the LED state. We do this by specifying the number of
//! // clock ticks directly, but a real program could use a library that allows
//! // us to specify the time in milliseconds.
//! // Each duration also keeps a reference to the clock, as to prevent other
//! // parts of the program from accidentally disabling the clock, or changing
//! // its settings.
//! let high_time = Ticks { value:  37_500, clock: &clock }; //  50 ms
//! let low_time  = Ticks { value: 712_500, clock: &clock }; // 950 ms
//!
//! // Since this is a simple example, we don't want to deal with interrupts
//! // here. Let's just use busy waiting as a sleeping strategy.
//! let mut sleep = sleep::Busy::prepare(&mut wkt);
//!
//! // Blink the LED
//! loop {
//!     pio0_3.set_high();
//!     sleep.sleep(high_time);
//!     pio0_3.set_low();
//!     sleep.sleep(low_time);
//! }
//! ```
